# Mashing docx with other modules

This is a list of interesting things you could do with Python docx when mashed up with other modules.

- [LinkedIn Python API](http://code.google.com/p/python-linkedin/) - Auto-build a Word doc whenever some old recruiting dude asks one.
- [Python Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) - can analyse text and extract meaning.
- [Lamson](http://lamsonproject.org/) - transparently parse or modify email attachments.
